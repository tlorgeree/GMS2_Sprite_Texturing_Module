This is a GMS2 module for mapping sprites to textures to automate animation. This takes inspiration from the following YouTube video:  https://youtu.be/HsOKwUwL1bE?si=vn6IuE7HAPHZ2So4.

Since you cannot directly edit sprites in GMS2, this stores sprite data in buffers and manipulates the data from there, then uses surfaces to create the new sprites.
